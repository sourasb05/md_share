# Decisions

- 2026-10-08 — Sync server: Hocuspocus 4.7 (open source, MIT) instead of a hand-written WebSocket server.
- 2026-10-08 — Audience: research group first, internal testing; public later.
- 2026-10-08 — LaTeX math (KaTeX, `$...$` and `$$...$$`) is part of the MVP.
- 2026-10-08 — Self-hosted. SQLite for now; move to PostgreSQL if several servers are needed.
- 2026-10-08 — Access for the MVP: one shared group password; personal accounts in M4.
- 2026-10-08 — Security hardening (before M4), no new dependencies:
  - Server-side sessions in SQLite (only SHA-256 of the token stored), 7-day expiry, real logout that
    also disconnects open editors. `SESSION_SECRET` is no longer used. Changing `GROUP_PASSWORD`
    ends all sessions (a salted scrypt fingerprint of it is kept in the `meta` table).
  - Listen on 127.0.0.1 by default; refuse to listen elsewhere without a password; password ≥ 12 chars.
  - Login throttling: 5 failures per IP per 15 min (in memory). Client IP via Express `trust proxy`
    (`TRUST_PROXY`, default loopback) so it can't be spoofed by clients.
  - Origin must match Host for every non-GET request and for the WebSocket handshake
    (rejected in Hocuspocus `onUpgrade`, before any document is loaded). Cookies stay SameSite=Lax so
    shared note links still open while logged in.
  - CSP: connect-src only our own ws(s) origin; images only self/data/blob (external images blocked
    to prevent read-tracking); form-action 'self'. style-src keeps 'unsafe-inline' because
    CodeMirror and KaTeX need inline styles.
  - DOMPurify also forbids <style> and form controls in notes.
  - Docker: non-root user, read-only root filesystem, all capabilities dropped, no-new-privileges.
  - Not done: per-note size cap (rejecting Yjs updates could leave a note stuck); waits for M4/M6.
- 2026-10-08 — AI rephrase (select text → Claude suggests a rewrite):
  - New dependency `@anthropic-ai/sdk` (official client: typed errors, retries, timeouts) instead of
    hand-written HTTP calls.
  - The server only returns a suggestion; the browser applies it through CodeMirror → yCollab → Yjs,
    so it syncs like any edit, is undoable, and no server-side text editing is needed. Yjs relative
    positions track the selection; if the text changed meanwhile, the replacement is refused.
  - Model `claude-opus-5-5` at effort `low` (simple task), overridable with `AI_MODEL`; server-side
    refusal fallback (`fallbacks: "default"`) enabled.
  - Off unless `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set. Same access checks as other routes, max 4000 characters,
    10 requests per person per minute. Only the selection is sent to Anthropic.
- 2026-10-08 — Editor redesign: formatting toolbar, text colour and highlight, personal appearance.
  - Colours are written into the Markdown as `<span style="color:#hex">` / `<mark style="background-color:#hex">`
    (portable, visible to everyone). The sanitiser keeps only `color`/`background-color` with hex values in
    note HTML; KaTeX's own output keeps its layout styles, and `#preview` has `contain: paint` so nothing
    in a note can draw outside the page.
  - Fonts, text size, theme (Auto/Light/Paper/Dark) and page width are per-person settings in
    localStorage, applied before first paint by `public/theme.js` (an external script, CSP-safe).
  - Fonts are self-hosted (the CSP blocks font CDNs): new devDependencies @fontsource-variable/inter,
    source-serif-4, literata, jetbrains-mono and @fontsource/atkinson-hyperlegible, copied by the build
    (latin subset, ~460 KB total). @codemirror/language and @lezer/highlight are now declared
    explicitly (they were already installed via CodeMirror) for the theme-aware syntax colours.
  - All toolbar actions are CodeMirror changes, so they sync through Yjs and are undoable.
- 2026-10-08 — Published to a public GitHub repo. `.gitignore` keeps out `.env*` (except `.env.example`),
  `data/` and any `*.sqlite*`, build output and test screenshots; commits use the GitHub noreply email.
  Added SECURITY.md (private vulnerability reporting). README now combines the product overview and the
  technical guide; screenshots live in docs/images/.
- 2026-10-08 — License: GNU AGPL-3.0-or-later. Keeps the public code open while stopping closed hosted
  forks (modified network deployments must share their source), and leaves the author free to sell
  hosting or dual-license. All ~200 dependencies are permissive (MIT/ISC/BSD/Apache/MPL-or-Apache, fonts
  OFL-1.1) and AGPL-compatible. Home page links to the source code (AGPL §13). package.json stays
  "private" so it is never published to npm by accident.
- 2026-10-09 — M4 personal sign-in, "My notes" / "Shared with me", private / view / edit links.
  - Sign-in: email magic link AND GitHub OAuth (user's choice); access by email domain only (`ALLOWED_DOMAINS`,
    subdomains included). GitHub accounts need a *verified* address at an allowed domain. Accounts are keyed by
    email, so both methods reach the same account. No passwords stored. `GROUP_PASSWORD` removed.
  - Magic links: 32-byte random token, only its SHA-256 stored, single use, 15 min. The emailed GET link shows a
    confirm button and the POST consumes it, so mail scanners that prefetch links can't use them up.
    Rate limits: 3 emails per address and 10 per IP per 15 min. Without SMTP_URL links are printed to the log.
  - New dependency nodemailer (MIT-0, no sub-dependencies) to send sign-in emails over SMTP. GitHub OAuth uses
    plain fetch (no dependency); GITHUB_OAUTH_URL / GITHUB_API_URL exist only so tests can use a fake GitHub.
  - Access = max(owner, member role, link setting). Checked on every page/API route and in Hocuspocus onConnect;
    viewers get `connectionConfig.readOnly = true`, so the server discards their updates. Sharing changes call
    refreshConnections(): 4403 closes revoked editors, 4409 makes changed ones reconnect with new rights.
  - Removing a domain from ALLOWED_DOMAINS invalidates its sessions (domain re-checked on every request).
  - Migration: notes created before M4 have no owner and become link_edit (existing links keep working);
    OWNER_FOR_EXISTING_NOTES hands them to one person. Old group sessions are dropped.
  - Local mode (no ALLOWED_DOMAINS, loopback only): one implicit user, so trying it out needs no setup.
- 2026-10-09 — Pilot readiness:
  - CI (GitHub Actions, Node 22 + 24): npm audit (high+ fails), build, security, access, rephrase, backup drill,
    two-person editing and formatting tests on every push/PR. No secrets needed (fake Claude and GitHub).
    two-users.mjs now exits non-zero on failure so CI can catch it.
  - Dependabot: weekly updates for npm, GitHub Actions and the Docker base image; security alerts and fixes on.
    Private vulnerability reporting on (SECURITY.md points to it).
  - GET /healthz (public, reveals only ok / database unavailable); Docker HEALTHCHECK uses it.
  - scripts/backup.mjs: SQLite online backup (safe while running), integrity check, keep newest N.
    scripts/restore.mjs: refuses while the port is in use or the file is damaged; keeps the old DB for undo.
    test/backup.mjs rehearses backup → change → restore → verify (saved text and live Yjs document).
  - Docker: multi-stage build on node:24-trixie-slim; npm/corepack removed from the runtime image. The base-image
    scan went from 4 critical + 21 high to 0 critical + 9 high. Image build itself not yet tested (no Docker here).
- 2026-10-09 — `main` protected with a repository ruleset ("Protect main"): changes only via pull request, CI jobs
  `test (22)` and `test (24)` must pass, no force-push, no deletion. Repository admins may bypass in an emergency.
  No approving review required (single maintainer). The first protected PR fixed a flaky sign-out test that had
  made CI fail at random.
