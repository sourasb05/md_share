> **Write the notes, the equations and the to-do list together, live.**

MdShare is a shared notebook for research groups. Open a link and everyone types into the same page
at once, with LaTeX math that renders as you write. It runs on your own server, so your notes stay with you.

## What it is

A web app for writing **shared notes in Markdown with LaTeX math**. Several people edit the same note at
the same time and see each other's cursors, while a formatted preview with properly typeset equations
updates as they type. There is no project setup and no compile step, and notes are plain Markdown you can take anywhere.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **In one line** | Google-Docs-style live editing for Markdown + LaTeX, on your own server |
| **Format** | Plain Markdown with `$…$` and `$$…$$` math |
| **Runs as** | One Node.js process and one SQLite file, ideally behind HTTPS |
| **Used in** | Any modern browser, desktop or phone |

## Who it's for

The core user is a **research group of 5–40 people** that meets weekly and keeps shared notes.

- **Research labs and groups:** meeting notes, experiment logs and derivations that everyone edits during the meeting.
- **Reading groups and journal clubs:** one page per paper with the key equations, open questions and who follows up.
- **Supervisors and PhD students:** a running supervision log with feedback, next steps and the maths being discussed.
- **Teaching teams:** tutorial sheets, worked solutions and live problem-solving in class.
- **Small R&D teams:** design and modelling notes where the formulas matter and the data must stay in-house.
- **Departments and research IT:** a tool that can run on university infrastructure, with no per-seat licence and no notes sent to a vendor's cloud.

## What it does

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Write together, live** | Everyone edits the same note at once, and changes merge automatically, with no "someone else is editing" locks. Named, coloured cursors show who is where, plus a count of who's online. Short connection drops are fine: edits sync when you reconnect. |
| **Share deliberately** | Everyone signs in with their own account (email link or GitHub). New notes are private; share them with named people as viewer, editor or owner, or open them to everyone signed in, read-only or editable. **My notes** and **Shared with me** keep it all findable. |
| **Math that renders as you type** | Inline `$…$` and display `$$…$$` LaTeX, typeset by KaTeX. Edit, side-by-side or reading view. Code blocks with syntax colouring. |
| **A formatting toolbar** | Headings, bold, italic, strikethrough, code, lists, quotes, links, tables and equations, with keyboard shortcuts. Everything is undoable with Ctrl+Z. |
| **Text colour and highlights** | 10 preset colours or any custom colour. Everyone sees them, and they stay in the downloaded file. |
| **Read it your way** | Each person chooses their own editor and reading fonts, text size, page width, and Light, Paper or Dark theme. Works on phones. |
| **AI rephrase (optional)** | Select a passage and Claude suggests a clearer version with the same meaning, keeping math and formatting exact. Edit it, or ask for "shorter" or "more formal", before replacing. It never overwrites a colleague's edit made in the meantime. |

### How live editing works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A["Alice types"] -- "the edit (a few bytes)" --> S["MdShare server<br/>merges and relays edits"]
  S -- broadcast --> B["Bob's screen"]
  S -- broadcast --> C["Carol's screen"]
  S -- "saved ~1.5 s after typing stops" --> D[("Database")]
```

Each keystroke sends only the change, not the whole note. Everyone's copy merges to the same text even
when people type at the same moment (Yjs, a conflict-free data type).

## Why it helps

| Situation | Without MdShare | With MdShare |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Equations in meeting notes | Photos of the whiteboard, or LaTeX pasted as raw text | Type `$\eta = 3\times10^{-4}$` and everyone sees it typeset |
| Several note-takers | One person types; others email corrections afterwards | Everyone writes into the same page during the meeting |
| Finding last month's notes | Scattered across inboxes, chats and personal files | One list of notes, newest first, for the whole group |
| Reusing notes later | Locked in a document format, export needed | Plain Markdown: paste into a paper draft, a README or slides |
| Where the data lives | A vendor's cloud, under its terms | Your server and one database file you can back up |
| Cost | Per-seat subscriptions that grow with the group | No per-seat fee when self-hosted. One small server runs it |

**Compared with the usual alternatives** (by category; individual products differ):

| | MdShare | Cloud document editors | LaTeX project editors | Files on a shared drive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Live co-editing | **Yes**, named cursors | Yes | Yes | No: copies conflict |
| Typing LaTeX math | **Yes**, renders instantly | Limited equation tools | Yes, after a compile | Depends on the file |
| Quick notes, no setup | **Yes**: open a link | Yes | Needs a project | Open, edit, re-upload |
| Portable plain-text format | **Markdown** (.md) | Export needed | .tex source | Varies |
| Runs on your own server | **Yes**, by design | Usually vendor-hosted | Some offer it | If the drive is yours |

## Security

Every request passes several independent checks, and every note is cleaned before it reaches anyone's screen.

```

**Protected today**

- **Personal sign-in, your domain only.** People sign in with a one-time email link or with GitHub, and only verified addresses at your allowed domains get in. No passwords are stored. Without sign-in configured, the server only accepts connections from the computer it runs on.
- **Private by default, shared on purpose.** New notes are private to their owner. Owners add people as viewer, editor or owner, or open the note to everyone signed in, read-only or editable. Every page, API call and live connection checks this.
- **Viewers really can't edit.** The server marks viewers' live connections read-only and discards any edit they send, even from a modified browser.
- **Changes apply instantly.** Removing someone, or making a note private, disconnects their open editor at once; promoting them reconnects them with the new rights.
- **Revocable sessions.** Sessions are stored on the server (only a SHA-256 hash of each token). Signing out disconnects open editors, and removing a domain from the allowlist locks its users out.
- **Abuse limits.** Sign-in links work once, expire after 15 minutes and survive mail scanners. Sign-in emails are rate-limited per address and per network address.
- **Other websites can't act for you.** Changes and live (WebSocket) connections are only accepted from MdShare's own pages, checked with the `Origin` header.
- **Notes can't attack readers.** HTML in notes passes through DOMPurify and a strict Content-Security-Policy: no scripts, forms, iframes or outside images, and only `color`/`background-color` styles.
- **Hardened deployment.** The Docker image runs as a non-root user with a read-only filesystem and no Linux capabilities. Behind HTTPS, cookies become `__Host-` + `Secure` and HSTS is sent.
- **AI is opt-in and minimal.** It's off until an administrator adds a key. Only the selected passage is sent, only when someone clicks Rephrase, and use is rate-limited per person.

**Not covered yet**

- **Domain-wide trust.** Anyone with a verified address at an allowed domain can sign in and create notes. They can only see notes shared with them, but there is no admin panel yet to block one person (remove their sessions or narrow the domain list).
- **No version history yet.** Run the nightly backup (`npm run backup`) and copy it off the server.
- **HTTPS is your hosting's job.** Use the included Caddy setup, and never expose MdShare on a network without HTTPS.
- **Not yet independently audited or load-tested at scale.**

**Tested:** 46/46 access checks (sign-in, private notes over HTTP and WebSocket, viewers' edits rejected, live
revocation, link sharing, GitHub), 37/37 security checks (signed-out access, forged cookies, cross-site requests,
open redirects, injected HTML, throttling), 23/23 formatting checks, 23/23 AI-rephrase checks, and a two-browser
co-editing test.

## Product description

**MdShare is a self-hosted, real-time collaborative Markdown editor with LaTeX math, made for research groups.**
A group member creates a note and shares its link. Everyone who opens it edits the same text at the same time,
sees named cursors, and watches a typeset preview update with every keystroke. Edits from several people merge
automatically, so no one is ever locked out or asked to resolve a conflict.

Writing is quick for experts and newcomers alike. Markdown and LaTeX can be typed directly, or applied from a
toolbar with headings, lists, tables, code, links, equations, text colours and highlights. Each reader picks their
own fonts, text size, page width and theme. An optional AI assistant, powered by Anthropic's Claude, can
rephrase a selected passage while keeping its meaning, numbers and math intact. Nothing changes until the author accepts.

MdShare runs as a single small service with one database file, on a lab machine, a university virtual machine or a
low-cost cloud server. Notes stay on that server and download as plain `.md` files at any time.

| Specification | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Deployment | Self-hosted: Docker Compose with a Caddy HTTPS proxy, or Node.js 20+ directly |
| Server footprint | One process and one SQLite database file. A small virtual machine is enough for a group |
| Real-time engine | [Yjs](https://yjs.dev) via [Hocuspocus](https://tiptap.dev/hocuspocus) over WebSocket |
| Editor and rendering | CodeMirror 6 · markdown-it · KaTeX · DOMPurify |
| Access control | Personal sign-in (email link or GitHub) limited to your domains; per-note owner / editor / viewer roles and private / view / edit links; server-side sessions; Origin checks |
| AI (optional) | Anthropic Claude via your own API key. Off by default |
| Data portability | Every note downloads as Markdown; all notes live in one file you can back up |
| Clients | Modern desktop and mobile browsers (tested in Chromium) |

**Ways to use it:** run it yourself (self-hosted, no per-seat fee), have it hosted for your group (a managed
instance with HTTPS, backups and updates), or roll it out across a department on university infrastructure.

---

## Installation

MdShare needs **Node.js 20 or newer** (which includes `npm`) and **git**. Docker is only needed if you
deploy with Docker on a server.

### macOS

Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) if you don't have it, then Node.js and git:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install node git
```

### Windows

Install the LTS version of Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win),
or from PowerShell:

```powershell
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS
winget install Git.Git
```

Close and reopen the terminal afterwards so it finds the new commands.

### Linux (Ubuntu / Debian)

The `nodejs` package in the default repositories is often too old. Use NodeSource (or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs git
```

### Check it worked

```bash
node --version    # should print v20 or higher
npm --version
git --version
```

### Docker (servers only)

For the Docker setup, install Docker Engine with the Compose plugin ([Linux guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/))
or [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) on macOS and Windows. Check with `docker compose version`.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sourasb05/md_share.git
cd md_share
npm install
npm run build
npm start              # → http://localhost:3000
```

Open the same note in two browser windows to see live co-editing. Without sign-in configured, MdShare runs in
**local mode**: no accounts, and the server only listens on this computer (`127.0.0.1`), so nobody else on the
network can reach it. Stop the server with Ctrl+C.

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `command not found: node` / `'node' is not recognized` | Node.js isn't installed or the terminal was opened before installing. Install it (above) and open a new terminal |
| The page loads but the editor is blank | You skipped `npm run build`. Run it, then restart with `npm start` |
| `EADDRINUSE: address already in use` | Something else uses port 3000. Start on another port: `PORT=3001 npm start` (Windows PowerShell: `$env:PORT=3001; npm start`) |
| `Refusing to listen on 0.0.0.0 without ALLOWED_DOMAINS` | Sharing on a network requires sign-in. Set `ALLOWED_DOMAINS` as shown below |
| The sign-in email never arrives | Without `SMTP_URL` the link is printed in the server's terminal instead. With SMTP, check the server log for "sending sign-in email failed" and your spam folder |
| "Your GitHub account has no verified email address at an allowed domain" | Add and verify your university address under GitHub → Settings → Emails, or sign in by email |
| `npm install` fails while building `better-sqlite3` | Prebuilt files weren't available for your system. Install build tools and retry: macOS `xcode-select --install`, Ubuntu `sudo apt-get install -y build-essential python3`, Windows the "Desktop development with C++" workload of Visual Studio Build Tools |

On **Windows PowerShell**, set variables like this instead of `NAME=value npm start`:

```powershell
$env:ALLOWED_DOMAINS='your-uni.edu'; $env:HOST='0.0.0.0'; $env:PUBLIC_URL='https://notes.your-lab.org'; npm start
```

## Run it for your group

Everyone signs in personally, and only verified addresses at your domain(s) can join:

```bash
ALLOWED_DOMAINS=your-uni.edu PUBLIC_URL=https://notes.your-lab.org HOST=0.0.0.0 npm start
```

`ALLOWED_DOMAINS` also admits subdomains (`cs.your-uni.edu`). List several with commas: `uni.edu,partner.org`.

### Sign-in by email link

Set `SMTP_URL` and `MAIL_FROM` so MdShare can email one-time sign-in links, e.g. your university's mail server or
a transactional email service:

```bash
SMTP_URL='smtps://user:password@smtp.your-uni.edu:465'
MAIL_FROM='MdShare <notes@your-lab.org>'
```

Without `SMTP_URL`, links are printed in the server's terminal instead, which is handy for trying it out.

### Sign-in with GitHub (optional)

1. On GitHub, open **Settings → Developer settings → OAuth Apps → New OAuth App**.
2. Set **Homepage URL** to your `PUBLIC_URL` and **Authorization callback URL** to `PUBLIC_URL/auth/github/callback`
   (e.g. `https://notes.your-lab.org/auth/github/callback`).
3. Copy the **Client ID**, generate a **Client secret**, and set `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`.

MdShare only asks GitHub for the account's email addresses, and lets people in only with a **verified** address at
an allowed domain. Email and GitHub sign-in lead to the same account when the address matches.

### Sharing

New notes are **private**. In a note, **Share** lets the owner:

- add people by email as **Can view**, **Can edit** or **Owner** (they can be added before they ever sign in), and
- set general access: only people added, **anyone signed in with the link can view**, or **can edit**.

Notes others share with you, or that you open from a shared link, appear under **Shared with me** on the home page.
Notes created before sign-in existed stay editable by everyone signed in. To give them all to one person, start the
server once with `OWNER_FOR_EXISTING_NOTES=name@your-uni.edu`.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | 3000 | HTTP + WebSocket port |
| `HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Address to listen on. Anything other than localhost requires `ALLOWED_DOMAINS` |
| `ALLOWED_DOMAINS` | (empty = local mode) | Comma-separated email domains whose verified addresses may sign in (subdomains included) |
| `PUBLIC_URL` | `http://localhost:PORT` | The address people use, e.g. `https://notes.your-lab.org`. Used in sign-in links and the GitHub callback |
| `SMTP_URL` | (empty = print links) | Mail server for sign-in emails, e.g. `smtps://user:pass@smtp.host:465` |
| `MAIL_FROM` | — | Sender for sign-in emails (required with `SMTP_URL`) |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | (empty = off) | Turn on "Continue with GitHub" |
| `OWNER_FOR_EXISTING_NOTES` | — | One-off: give notes that have no owner to this address |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | `loopback` | Which reverse proxies may set `X-Forwarded-For/Proto` ([Express syntax](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/behind-proxies.html)) |
| `DATA_DIR` | `./data` | Where `mdshare.sqlite` lives. Back this folder up |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | (empty = AI off) | Turns on **Rephrase**. Get a key at console.anthropic.com |
| `AI_MODEL` | `claude-opus-5-5` | Claude model used for rephrasing |
| `AI_PER_MINUTE` | 10 | Rephrase requests allowed per person per minute (cost guard) |

### With Docker (recommended on a server)

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # then set ALLOWED_DOMAINS, PUBLIC_URL and the mail settings
mkdir -p data && sudo chown 1000:1000 data   # the container runs as an unprivileged user
docker compose up -d --build
```

Put it behind HTTPS (Caddy, nginx, or your department's reverse proxy). The proxy must pass WebSocket upgrades and
the `Host` header through. A Caddy example is in [`Caddyfile.example`](Caddyfile.example).

### Backups and restore

All notes, accounts and sharing settings live in `data/mdshare.sqlite`. Back it up every night:

```bash
npm run backup        # safe while the server runs; checks the copy; keeps the newest 14
```

Backups go to `data/backups/` (change with `BACKUP_DIR`, keep more with `BACKUP_KEEP`). **Also copy that folder to
another machine** (rsync, rclone, your university's storage): a backup on the same disk won't survive the disk.

Run it nightly with cron (`crontab -e`):

```cron
15 3 * * * cd /path/to/md_share && /usr/bin/env node scripts/backup.mjs >> data/backup.log 2>&1
```

With Docker: `15 3 * * * docker compose -f /path/to/md_share/docker-compose.yml exec -T mdshare node scripts/backup.mjs`

To restore, stop the server, then:

```bash
npm run restore -- data/backups/mdshare-2026-10-09_03-15-00-000.sqlite --yes
```

The current database is kept as `mdshare.sqlite.before-restore-…`, so a restore can be undone. The restore
script refuses to run while the server is up, and refuses damaged backups. `npm run test:backup` rehearses the
whole cycle (back up a live server → change notes → restore → check).

### Health check

`GET /healthz` returns `{"status":"ok"}` when the server can read its database (HTTP 503 otherwise). Point an
uptime monitor at `https://your-address/healthz`. The Docker image uses it as its health check.

## Keeping secrets out of git

This repository is public. Secrets and data are kept out by [`.gitignore`](.gitignore):

| Never commit | Why | Where it belongs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.env` | Holds the SMTP password, the GitHub client secret and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. A leaked API key can run up charges on your account | Copy from `.env.example` on the server only |
| `data/`, `*.sqlite` | Everyone's notes, accounts, sharing settings and sessions | The server's disk, plus your backups |
| Build output (`public/editor.js`, `public/chunks/`, `public/fonts/`…) | Recreated by `npm run build` | — |

If a secret is ever pushed by mistake, **revoke it immediately** (API key at console.anthropic.com, GitHub client secret in the OAuth app, SMTP password with your mail provider). Deleting the commit
is not enough, because public history is copied quickly. GitHub secret scanning and push protection are
enabled on this repository as a second line of defence.

## Writing and formatting

The toolbar has undo/redo, headings, bold/italic/strikethrough/code, **text colour**, **highlight colour**
(10 presets each, or any custom colour), links, quotes, lists, tables, code blocks, inline and block math, and
dividers. Shortcuts: Ctrl/Cmd+B, I, E (code), K (link), Shift+X (strikethrough), Shift+H (highlight with the last colour).

Colours are stored in the note as small HTML tags, e.g. `<mark style="background-color:#fff3a3">text</mark>`,
so everyone sees them and they survive download. Only `color` and `background-color` are allowed in notes;
any other inline CSS is removed. Images in notes must be `data:` URLs for now (image paste is planned):
external image links are blocked so outside servers can't track who reads a note.

**Aa** (top right) sets your own editor font, preview font, text size, theme (Auto, Light, Paper, Dark) and
page width. These are personal and stored in your browser only.

**AI rephrase.** With `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set, a **Rephrase** button appears. Select a passage, click it, and
Claude suggests a rewrite with the same meaning. You can edit the suggestion or ask for something different,
then click **Replace selection**. The replacement is an ordinary edit: everyone sees it live and Ctrl+Z undoes it.

## Development and tests

```bash
npx playwright install chromium     # once
npm run build
npm start                           # terminal 1
npm test                            # terminal 2: two browsers type into one note at once
npm run test:formatting             # toolbar, colours, highlights, appearance (needs npm start)
npm run test:access                 # sign-in, sharing, viewers can't edit (46 checks, own server + fake GitHub)
npm run test:security               # starts its own server and tries to break in (37 checks)
npm run test:rephrase               # AI rephrase against a fake Claude API (no key, no cost)
npm run test:backup                 # backup → change → restore drill
```

Every push runs all of these on GitHub Actions (Node 22 and 24); see the CI badge at the top. Dependabot opens
weekly pull requests for outdated packages, GitHub Actions and the Docker base image.

**Contributing:** `main` is protected. Make changes on a branch and open a pull request; it can be merged once
the CI checks pass on Node 22 and 24. Force-pushes and deleting `main` are blocked.

Design choices are logged in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md). [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) has the rules for AI coding

## FAQ

<details><summary><b>Where are our notes stored?</b></summary>

On the server you run MdShare on, in a single SQLite database file. Nothing is sent elsewhere, except the passages
someone explicitly asks the optional AI to rephrase.
</details>

<details><summary><b>Do we have to use the AI feature?</b></summary>

No. It stays off until an administrator sets `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Without it, the Rephrase button doesn't appear.
</details>

<details><summary><b>Can we get our notes out?</b></summary>

Yes. Any note downloads as a plain Markdown file, and colours and highlights are kept as simple HTML tags.
</details>

<details><summary><b>What happens if the Wi-Fi drops mid-meeting?</b></summary>

Keep typing. Your edits are kept in the open page and merge with everyone else's when the connection returns.
MdShare is not an offline app, though, so closing the tab while disconnected loses unsynced edits.
</details>

<details><summary><b>How many people can edit at once?</b></summary>

It is designed for a research group and has been tested with up to four people in one note. Formal load testing is planned (M6).
</details>
